In an industrial setting, developing a Machine Learning model requires many more steps than simple modeling on a learning game and evaluation on a test game. The majority of large companies have accumulated over the years a considerable volume of data relating to their trade. In most cases, this data has never been used for statistical analysis or advanced modeling. The objective of a Data department within a large company is therefore to successfully use data as a lever to gain performance. The first step is to identify use cases that could benefit from being optimized or automated: anomaly detection, attrition detection, prediction of failures, analysis of technical logs, etc.

## Context
You are a Data Scientist in the IT department in a large French company. The company generates a lot of data but for the moment no machine learning model has been set up to use it

## Statistical Data Analysis & Data Validation
From this step, you will focus on the dataset available from the following link:

company that employs you operates more than 3,000 stores in 7 countries Europeans. Currently, store managers are responsible for estimating their daily sales up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school holidays, seasonality and location. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their particular situation, the accuracy of the results can be very variable.
Perform a statistical analysis of the data set and draw conclusions that could help the sales teams. The objective of this step is to extract information from statistical indicators.

## Machine Learning
Create a Machine Learning model that addresses the use case problem from the data set. All the decisions taken concerning the choice of the evaluation metric, the validation strategy as well as the choice of the learning algorithm, must be justified. Note: the objective of this step is not to optimize a hundredth of a point the loss of the learning algorithm but to establish an argued methodology and put it into practice.
## Presentation of results & Recommendations

Perform a performance analysis of the model from a professional point of view to convince decision makers of the relevance of the industrialization of the model. Recommendations on industrialization should be presented as well as an application presenting the results of the model visually. The application must use the Machine Learning model that you previously developed and be intended for end users.
##Industrialization
Consider and analyze production issues in the context of your project: maintenance, interpretability, security.
